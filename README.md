[Hede.io](https://hede.io) Hede is the first Steem Interface letting authors to create collaborative Wikis on Steem and contribute to them with their posts. Because of the nature of steem, people can not change others' posts so it makes creating one big chunk of text based wikis not suitable for Steem. On Hede we solved this by letting  each topic consisting of multiple posts(entries). 
Information shared does not need to be correct and might even contain subjective opinions. We encourage authors to share their experience based knowledge on hede.


Forked from https://github.com/busyorg/busy, and https://github.com/hede-io/hede.io Hede uses the [STEEM Blockchain](https://steem.io) to reward writers in cryptocurrency.
